# Android Live Wallpaper Starter

A project that gets you a few more things than the standard example code provided by Google.  Implemented with Android Studio.

Features:
* Clean isolation of 'application' code from the various Android boilerplate.
* Wallpaper configuration UI and mapping to a user-defined class for configuration and other state.
* Persistence of wallpaper state.
* Sample code of a working live wallpaper that can be easily deleted or customized.
* Inclusion of some modern libraries to make things nicer: Otto, Timber, Guava, and Dagger.
* A debug option to show draw frame rates.
